      <p>It’s a good practice to never leave the house without a water bottle, especially when you’re headed to school for the day and you don’t want to drop that extra cash on overpriced water from the campus cafe. It would be a good idea to invest in a reusable water bottle with insulation that can retain your water’s temperature throughout the day— this would be especially useful on those hot summer days. Make sure you’re staying hydrated throughout the day by drinking enough water— this can promote concentration, prevent headaches, and improve many other areas too.</p>

      <p>Everyone knows to bring their laptops and phones to school, but equally important are the mechanical tools that were used back in grade school. Studies have shown that taking notes with pen and paper promote memorization and makes studying for future exams easier. For organization and easy access, consider carrying all of your essentials in a pencil case. This will make everything easier to find and instantly declutter your backpack. Besides just pens and pencils, you could also carry a flash drive, ruler, tape, and scissors— you can never be too prepared!</p>

      <p>The lip balm is tiny but mighty! I think we can all agree that having chapped lips is not a good feeling. Just like water, it would be a good idea to keep lip balm with you at all times— it would be unfortunate to be stuck at school all day with dry, chapped lips and worry about them cracking or forming cold sores. Lip balm is good for other things too, like: soothing wounds, smoothing out flyaway hairs, reducing redness, preventing shoe blisters, and many more! Make sure you put it somewhere you’ll be able to easily find it, like a smaller pouch in front of your backpack, or your pencil pouch.</p>
