      <p>It’s a good practice to never leave the house without a water bottle, especially when you’re headed to school for the day and you don’t want to drop that extra cash on overpriced water from the campus cafe. It would be a good idea to invest in a reusable water bottle with insulation that can retain your water’s temperature throughout the day— this would be especially useful on those hot summer days. Make sure you’re staying hydrated throughout the day by drinking enough water— this can promote concentration, prevent headaches, and improve many other areas too!</p>

      <p>Everyone knows to bring their laptops and phones to school, but equally important are the mechanical tools that were used back in grade school. For organization and easy access, consider carrying all of your essentials in a pencil case. Besides just pens and pencils, you could also carry a flash drive, ruler, tape or glue stick, and scissors— you can never be too prepared and you’ll be everyone’s best friend!</p>

    <section id="lip">

      <p>The lip balm is tiny but mighty! I think we can all agree that having chapped lips is not a good feeling. Just like water, it would be a good idea to keep lip balm with you at all times— it would be unfortunate to be stuck at school all day with dry, chapped lips and worry about the cracking or growing cold sores. Lip balm is good for other things too, like: soothing wounds, smooth out flyaway hairs, prevent shoe blisters, and many more!</p>
