    <h2><a href="https://imaginingamerica.org/">Imagining America</a></h2>

    <p>Imagining America was launched in 1999 as a reaction to arts, design, and humanities being underrepresented and values of reciprocity and mutual benefit going unrealized. The White House Millennium Council, University of Michigan, and the Woodrow Wilson National fellowship Foundation came together to initiate Imagining America in 1999 at the White House Conference. Imagining America’s name reflects the theme of the White House Millennium Council “that focused on renewing participation in all walks of U.S. life: ‘Honor the Past — Imagine the Future’” (imaginingamerica.org).</p>

    <p>Participants from IA’s launch in 1999 became the foundation for what became its consortium of universities— University of Michigan agreed to be the first host, as Julie Ellison was a founding director. In 2007, IA found a new home at Syracuse University and Jan Cohen-Cruz served as the director through 2012. In its early years, IA: fostered “a national network of campus-community collaborators in humanities, arts, and design,... [developed] an analytical framework to identify and critically consider the range of emerging artistic and scholarly endeavors,... [and promoted] public scholarship as an important and legitimate enterprise in higher education” (imaginingamerica.org).</p>

    <p>In 2007, IA found a new home at Syracuse University and Jan Cohen-Cruz served as the director through 2012. At this point, IA had established itself among organizations that “push the boundaries of civic engagement in higher education” (imaginingamerica.org). After several years of research, IA released a distinguished report, Scholarship in Public: Knowledge Creation and Tenure Policy in the Engaged University by Julie Ellison and Timothy K. Eatman, IA’s research director. During these years, IA had developed collaboratories to effectively utilize its intellectual and creative capital. In order to do so, IA drew on research done by the consortium.</p>

    <p>Today, IA resides in the University of California, Davis— its third home as of 2017. IA’s annual agenda encompasses a national conference, organizing cultural institutes, collaborative research, and action projects. By offering opportunities for university student leaders, IA continues contributing resources to an expanding membership.</p>
